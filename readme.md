# P4: Where's my Stuff?
## A home inventory manager

This is a basic inventory application that allows the user to build an inventory list of items and correlate those items to where they may be located. The inventory list can be expanded and contracted as desired by the user. Locations are also customizable.

###Description and Details for the Teaching Team
This application uses three basic tables: users, locations and items. The items are the central source of truth with users and locations as foreign keys. Below is a link to the planning document for this project. You may view the routes and db plan. There are two users pre-seeded into the application: Jill and Jamal, with location data pre-seeded as well. The project doesn't use any external packages, but it does have SkeletonCSS downloaded to the CSS folder to make the site mostly responsive.
